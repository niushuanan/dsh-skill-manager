Current master ships complete native plugin folders and preserves each Settings entry's original plugin-owned icon. Remove its folder to uninstall the capability. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for shared compatibility patches and installation checks.

## Install

1. Choose **Code → Download ZIP** for current master; older Releases do not include this repair.
2. Give the ZIP to an AI that can read and modify the target DSH project.
3. Tell the AI: **Read AGENTS.md, INSTALL.md, and manifest.json first. Install only this plugin and preserve existing plugins, data, conversations, attachments, and settings.**
4. The installing AI merges the code and Cordis rows into the target version and validates only the entry points directly owned by this plugin.

## Contents

- <code>payload/</code>: plugin code and required runtime assets copied from the main repository.
